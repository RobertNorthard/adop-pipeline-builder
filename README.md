# The Integrated Pipeline builder

The Integrated Pipeline builder enables users to draw their production ready end to end Continuous Delivery pipeline network and from it generate a Cartridge Collection Loader file that can be loaded in ADOP to generate all of the required jobs.

If you load this cartridge it is possible to extend this tool.  Also look out for the related [Integrated Pipeline platform extension](https://github.com/statlus/adop-platform-extension-pipeline-builder) that can be used to add this to an ADOP.
